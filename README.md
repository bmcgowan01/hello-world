# hello-world
Hi Github, I'm Bethany McGowan! I'm a graduate student in an Interaction Design and Information Architecture program, studying User Research. I'm interested in designing consumer health technologies that make it easier and more desirable to manage chronic diseases and health issues, especially in minority communities. I'm also interested incorporating design into health literacy and health equity issues.

My goal over the next few months is to learn Ruby, then Java. Also to improve my HTML/CSS and Javascript skills.
